## 🌟 About Me

I'm a self-taught developer with a deep love for **Geometry Dash** and community-driven projects. My work blends technical problem-solving with creative expression, especially through **FrGDPS**, my passion-driven Geometry Dash Private Server.

I believe in:
- **Learning-first development** over chasing perfection  
- **Creative freedom** with respectful collaboration  
- **Embracing imperfection** as part of the journey  

My bugs have character. My crashes have personality. And my community? It has heart ❤️.
